## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) - React framework
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) - For styles
- [Sizzy](https://sizzy.co/) - For the responsive web design

### What I learned

Building this challenge project was an opportunity for me to try the [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) React styling library, I found the processus of building components really easy and well-thought. I've also used back the [Sizzy](https://sizzy.co/) app which is a wonderful app that has speeded up my development workflow for the responsive web design work.
